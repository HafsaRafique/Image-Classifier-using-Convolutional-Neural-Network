# Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks

This project demonstrates how to build an image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow and Keras. The classifier is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The classes are: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck.

## Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them via pip:

pip install opencv-python tensorflow matplotlib
